Alaska Railroad service remained shut down north of Talkeetna on Monday due to flooding from an ice jam on the Susitna River that pushed a 6- to 8-foot wall of ice onto the tracks.

The ice pushed nearly 1,000 feet of track off the railbed by more than 25 feet in some locations along a 3-mile stretch of the railroad, according to a Monday news release from the Alaska Railroad. Floodwaters also scoured the railbed ballast.

The damage occurred along a portion of railroad that is west of about mile 137 of the Parks Highway. It is between railroad mileposts 247 and 250."
